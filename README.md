# Band-Website

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
!!!Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is for fans and new fans of the band Scorpions, who want to listen to their music, view band photos, check their tour schedule and to able to contact them in order to organise gigs.

As a user, I want to use the webstie to

(a) listen to the bands music and watch their videos (should include atleast one video clip),

(b) find links to their social media and other media pages (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, iTunes, Spotify).

(c) look at photos of the bands tour, idividual band member profile and other promo photos.

(d) see the bands tour dates, and availability for booking and are able to contact the band to organise gigs.

Wireframes, mockups, diagrams

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The website will have four separate pages, (1) a home page, (2) a music page, (3) a photo page and (4) a gig hire page. Each page will have the same header and footer sections for consitency.

The home page will display a video, one or two examples of their music, a brief description of the band, including a list of band members and a list of tour dates. This will give a solid introduction to the band for new fans and allows them to try their music.

The music page will contain more of the bands music. However it will not be used to display all of their music as external links to Spotify and iTunes will be provided.  

The photos page will contain a vast variety of the band members and pictures of their tours.

The gig hire page will have a contact form and will contain a list of scheduled gigs and dates of availability for fire. This allows user to have a clear understanding of where the band will be playing and where they will be available.


With this in mind, I plan on using external links to Scorpions Spotify and iTunes music playist. This is to provide fans with secondary options of ways to listen to their music. 

The home page will also feature 2 of their new tracks as a preview for their music cataloge. This will be good for attracting new fans. The home page will also include a music video of one their most famous tracks, as another preview of their music cathologe, followed by a link to their YouTube channel. After demonstated
 
### Existing Features

#### Header and Footer

The header will have links to each page to allow for consistant easy access for users and so they dont have to keep navigating around the website to find the correct page. It will also contain the bands logo and a photo of the whole band. This gives new fans an idea to what kind of band the Scorpions are.

As this website will be primarily be used for users to listen to the bands music, I will contain links to the band's Spotify and iTunes accounts on both the header and footer. This is important because it will allow the user to have consistant access to their full music library, from each page. Having consistant links to Spotify and iTunes is also important for the band because the band makes money from these sites.

The footer will include a small logo, copywrite text aswell as a list of all their social media pages. Most of the social media links will be kept on the footer only because they are of secondary importance, however being kept at the footer will allow the user to have consistent access to them. Links to Facebook and Twitter will be included in the list, along with Spotify and iTunes.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Home Page

The home page page will consist of three sections: (a) A promotion of two songs from their latest (b) a list of tour dates, 
and the (c) main section which is largest part of the page and will have varied content.

The top of the main section will have a video promotion to promote the bands tour. This is so fans are immediately of the tour.
Below the video will be a very description of the band and the website, this is primarily for new potential fans to take interest.
Then below the description will be a list of the band members in the band, which is also for new potential fans.

The new songs promotion and tour dates list will be stacked ontop of each other to the right to create a side bar. All three sections will have different background colours to make the impression that they are different.

I am trying to make the home page to be as random as possible, 
while also providing as much previews and important fan content. 
I got the inspirations from other band websites, such as Metallicas and Iron Maidens, 
which both also has a 'random content' feel.

For the tour guide list, I used Metallica's tour guide list as a guide on text sizes and designs.

#### Music Page

I will use this page to display all the sample songs I intend have available. There will be three albums on display, with two tracks chosen from each album.

For the track controls, I used simular design and the same sizes of the track controls and track headings.

The first Album will be latest album and will contain the two tracks from the home page. 
This is to help fans find the new tracks more easily. The other two albums will two of their classic albums from the 80's.

I will provide spotify and iTunes links on each album. Each will link the user to the full albums that are ready to be purchased or played.
I will used the same colour schemes from and design patterns from the home page to provide consitency for the users.

I took inspiration from other bands Discography pages on their website, particularly on how they display the album cover picture and details
Metallica's and Iron Maiden's website were once again an inspiration in terms of design.

#### Photos Page

For the photos page I utilized a lightbox system. 

Upon opening the Photos page, there is a collection of photos available for the user to see. The user can't see the image at its full capacity, but all the images are matching at the same width and height, without being stretched. 
They are also evenly alligned at different screen lengths. The images are small enough for the user to get a full grasp of all the images on their first glance.

Upon clicking an image of their choosing, a lightbox pops up. In which displays the image as big as possible. The individual images are large enough for the user to grasp them. 

Below the enlarged image on the lightbox, the user can see the same collection of images from initally opening the photos page. 
This is to allow the user to search through the images without closing the lightbox. 
I also utilised next and previous buttons for the user to schroll though all the pictures. 
The two buttons are in a fixed position so they wont move when clicking through, this is important because the lightbox changes its size depending on the image. 
Keeping them in place provides a better user experience. 
There is also an x button on the top incase the user wants to go back to the main page, where they can navigate the website again.

This system for a photo collection is used on many bands websites such as metallicas. 

For further information of the technology of the lightbox please view the Technologies Used section below.

I also used the same color schemes from the Music Page to keep the website as consistant as possible, however the main-section (grey background is alot wider than on the Music Page. This was to keep as many of the images as possible in view.)

### Features Left to implement

#### More content on the home page, and removal of content from the home page.

I may also had more content to the home page, such as fan art, music videos and news feeds.

I may also remove content, such as the band/website descrion and list of band members. 
I could create a History page which would go through this kind of informtion in more detail instead.

If I was to remove this information, it would mean the Home Page would be primarily used for previews of webpage content and promotional materials.
Other bands have used their home page primarily for this reason. 
I believe that displaying audio, video and photographic material is the best way to have fans interested in the website and it makes the website more interactive.

#### Expansion on the Music page.
I indend to create a more complex UI system for the Music Page. 
I will have the music page display all the album covers as images. 
Each Album cover will work as a link. 
Each link will bring the user to a page dedicated to the album, providing full details and credits of the album, full song lists and song lyrics. 
From this page I will also have a link that brings the user back to the album listings page, for better user experience.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
    -
    - Code for lightbox, from w3schools ( link: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp ; ).
      Upon utilizing this code, I removed the column class and column css styling, and used bootstrap column grid system instead. 
      This was to keep the website consistant with its use of Bootstrap. I also made several changed to the styling ( see the Existing Features about).

## Testing
h  
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
