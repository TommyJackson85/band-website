# Band-Website

This website is for fans and new fans of the band Scorpions. 
It will be designed to engage fans into listening to the bands music and potentially purchase the bands music on their iTunes and spotify accounts.
Fans will also be allowed view the band photos, check their tour schedule and be able to contact them in order to organise gigs.

The website will allow fans to find most information and content on the Scorpions. 
The initially home page will be used to promote the bands music and tour schedule but will also have a brief description of the band to engage new fans. 
There will then be individual pages, for the bands content and other uses. There will be a photos page for their photo collection, a music page for their music catalogue and a hire page to allow the user to contact the band for hire.
The website will also be used to promote their social media pages, through the use of external links.
There will be links to the bands iTunes and Spotify accounts on the header of each page, and Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube links in the footer of each page.
The website will initially have four pages. 
It will have a home page which will contain promotions and a brief description of the band.
The promotions will include a tour promotional video, tour dates and sample songs from their latest album. 
There will also be a music page containing songs from three of their albums, a photo page containing multiple photos to view in full, and a hire page where the user can contact the band directly to hire them for gigs


## UX

As a user, I want to use the webstie to

- listen to the bands music and watch videos (should include atleast one video clip),
- find links to their social media and other media pages (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, iTunes, Spotify).
- look at photos of the band on tour and of each idividual band member.
- see the bands tour dates, and availability for booking and are able to contact the band to organise gigs.

Wireframes, mockups, diagrams
I used the Iron Maiden website (https://ironmaiden.com/)
and Metallica's website (https://www.metallica.com/)
for design and content inspiration, however I kept the design as possible for this website.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The website will have four separate pages, (1) a home page, (2) a music page, (3) a photo page and (4) a gig hire page. Each page will have the same header and footer sections for consitency.

- The home page will display a promotional video, one or two examples of their music, a brief description of the band, including a list of band members and a list of tour dates. This will give a solid introduction to the band for new fans and allows them to try their music.

- The music page will contain more samples of the of the bands music. 

- The photos page will contain a vast variety of photos of their previous tours.

- The gig hire page will have a contact form and will contain a list of scheduled gigs and dates of availability for hire. This allows user to have a clear understanding of where the band will be playing and where they will be available for gigs.

 
### Existing Features

#### Header and Footer
I used the code from for the header and footer sections of the resume project as a starting point to work from.

I kept the same structure of the resume project header but I added an image of the band's logo/name and two external inks for the bands Spotify and iTunes accounts.
Having external link to the bands music on the header is important because this website is primarily used to promote the bands music.

The header has links to each page of website to allow for consistant easy access for users. 
On each page, the header indicates to the user which page they are on, 
by having the related page link button have a lighter background color. 
All of this is so the user won't be lost when navigating around the website.

Alot of bands have diffent size headers. Some are big mast heads while others are slimmer and just contain the needed functionality and display.
I decided to make the header medium sized

There is a photo of the whole band on the header, on smaller screens it is on the top and on larger screens it is too the left.  
This image gives new fans an idea of what kind of band the Scorpions are.

I made the page links small/slim with extra margin space at the bottom, so that black background can be partially seen at the bottom. 
This is so the the links feel they are part of the header and not just attched under the bottom.

I also kept most of the structure of the footer (from the resume project) in place.
The footer includes a small logo, copywrite text and a list of all their social media pages. 

Most of the social media links will be kept on the footer only because they are of secondary importance (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube). 
Having iTunes and Spotify in the header makes more sense because they are of more importance. They are essential for the bands buisness.

In general, having external links on the footer and header will allow the user to have consistent access to them.

In the future, I might add more pages to the website, which means I will add more page links to the footer.
With this in mind. I might have to remove the band image from the header to allow more space

- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Home Page

The home page page will consist of three columns: 
- (a) A promotion of two songs from their latest album
- (b) A list of tour dates 
- (c) A main section (class-"main-section") which is largest part of the page and will have varied content.

(a) and (b) will be stacked on top of each other. 
On small screens they will be below the main section but on larger screens they will be pushed to the right
like they are a side bar.

The top of the main section will have a video promotion to promote the band's tour. This is so fans are immediately aware of the tour.
Below the video will be a very description of the band and the website, this is for new potential fans to be introduced to the band.
Then below the description will be a list of the band members in the band, which is also for new potential fans.

The new songs promotion and tour dates list will be stacked on top pf each other. 
All three sections will have different background colours to keep them separate.

I am trying to make the home page as random as possible, 
while also providing as much previews and important fan content. 
I got the inspirations from other band websites, such as Metallicas and Iron Maidens, 
which both also had a 'random content' feel.

For the tour guide list, I used Metallica's tour guide list as a guide on text sizes and designs.

##### Future changes
I may add other content, such as fan art and music videos the home page. I will either put it on the main section or in the form of another side bar column. 
I got the idea of Fan Art from the Iron Maiden website. I feel it adds a sense of 'personal aknowledgement' of the fans.
With this new material in mind, I may consider adding links to new pages, specifically for each set of content. I will either add the links to the header or on the home page. 

In general, I think the home page should have as much interactive content as possible. 
With this in mind, I may consider removing the band description section and move it to a new page that talks about the band and it's history. 
I will add a link to this page in the header.

#### Music Page

I am using this page to display all the sample songs I intend to have available. 
There will be three albums on display with a picture of the album cover, the album heading and year release and external links to the albums Spotify and iTunes accounts. 

Underneat each album display on small screens, I displayed two listenable tracks chosen from the album. On larger screens I pushed the tracks to the right, aligning them next to the album display to the right.
For the track listings I reused most of the the code and styling from the music section the of the home page, keeping it consistant.

The first Album on display will be latest album and will contain the two tracks from the home page. 
The other two albums will be two of their classic albums from the 80's.

I took inspiration from other bands Discography pages on their website, particularly on how they display the album cover picture and details.

##### Future changes
I will consider making all of their albums on for display, in which the initial music page will just display all the album cover images, aligned next to each other. Each link will link to a new page, that displays the albums full track listings and full production credits. From here the user will be able to read each song's lyrics. 
I may also add more sample tracks for each album, however I will still have links to the album's Spotify and iTunes accounts.
This building process will require ae a more complex UI wireframe, so I will add links to each albums page that will give the user the option to return to the full album listing and home page. I may also inlude the same header or footer for consistency.

Many band websites used this type of wireframe, for example: https://ironmaiden.com/discography/studio-albums

#### Photos Page

For the photos page I utilized a lightbox system. 

Upon opening the Photos page, there is a collection of photos available for the user to see. The user can't see the image at its full capacity, but all the images are matching at the same width and height, without being stretched. 
They are also evenly alligned at different screen lengths. The images are small enough for the user to get a full grasp of all the images on their first glance.

Upon clicking an image of their choosing, a lightbox pops up. 
The light box displays the image fully from the top. 
It displays each image as large as possible, 
without the user having to schroll up and down to see 
all of the whole image. 
The image size increases in size on on larger screens.
The image caption is displayed right below the enlarged image.

Below the enlarged image, 
the user can see the same collection of images from initally opening the photos page. 
This is to allow the user to search through the images without closing the lightbox. 
I also utilised next and previous buttons for the user to schroll though all the pictures.

The enlarged image and image caption are both placed in a parent div. The parent div has the exact same height for all selected images. 
This was important because all the images vary in dimensions and sizes. The constant changes of image sizes/dimensions (from clicking the next and previous buttons, and clicking other images)
doesn't move the remaining page content around (i.e. outside the parent div) because the the enlarged image's parent div remains the same in size.

This makes for a good user experience and does not cause confusion.

There is also an x button on the top incase the user wants to go back to the main page, where they can navigate through the website again.

I chose to use the lightbox system because it is commonly used on many websites, 
for example: https://ironmaiden.com/gallery


For further information on the technology of the lightbox please view the Technologies Used section below.

I also used the same color schemes from the Music Page to keep the website as consistant as possible, however the main-section (grey background is alot wider than on the Music Page. 
This was to keep as many of the images as possible in view.)

##### Future changes
 
I may only make small changes to the design and add more photos. 

However I may also  remove the photo-previews from the lightbox box. 
I think it might be better for the light box to only have the enlarged photo because there is already a photo preview at the start of the music page. 
Including a photo preview in the bottom of the modal is making the user have to scroll to the bottom all the time. 
When the user scrolls to the bottom, the 'X' buttom (at the top of the modal) is hidden. T
his might be causing a negative user experience, however I still feel it is also helpful for the user to be able to choose specific images from the modal.

#### Hire Page

The hire page will be used to promote the available tour dates and will contain a simple 
Bootstrap contact form, which requires the users email, first and last names, and a message.

Above the form I ask the user to include information on the date and location of an event and any other information that is relevent.

I also remind the user about the up and coming tour and suggest the user refers to the available dates list when booking.

I will have two columns that turn into an inner side bar on wider screens (the side bar is located inside the 'main-section class div' for this page). The fist column will be a list of available dates for booking gigs, 
simular in design to the tour dates list on the home page, but will have a different colour background. 
The second column will be a the same Tour Dates list from the homepage. Both columns use the same design patterns as the tour dates list on the home page.

I added a tour dates list to this page because I felt it was related to subject of band hiring. 
It is helpful for the user to be aware of the booked tour dates and booked locations.

##### Future changes

I might add more form inputs to the form and I might change the design of the tour and dates for hire listings.

#### Color schemes (of all pages)

I first used the background color of the footer image as the backgound color for the footer.
The main purpose for this was to blend the image background to the footer background. 
I then reused this color for the header background to keep the website consistant in color tone.

I only use black as the background color of the footer and header to keep them distinguished from other parts of the website. The only other use of black was for the background of the lightbox in the photo section. 
This was because it didn't use the header or footer. .

On the basis of using the color black, I decided to use mostly darker colours for other parts of the website to keep it consistant in tone.

I used a dark color red for the page links to keep them differentiated from the header background. 
For the page link button that links to the page in use, I used a lighter red background. 
This is to give an indication to the user where they are on the site.

I used the same darker red for each page background (on larger screens) except for the Home page. 
The 'main-section' class div on the home page doesn't have any right or left margins on small or large screens, so the background is not visable anyway.
However I did use the darker red for the music column on the home page.

For the main section (under the class 'main-section') of each page, I used a dark grey for the background color. 
The use of a dark gray keeps it separate from the header and footer. 
However the use of black and dark grey blend well together in tone.
Further more, the use of black, dark grey and dark colors are well suited for a metal band / heavy rock band website. 
All three colours are the most consistently used background colour schemes of the whole website, although sometimes in darker or brighter tones.

I used dark yellow and dark green as secondary background colours. 
I used dark yellow for the tour dates list (on both the home page and hire us page) 
and the dark green for the 'dates available for booking'.
This distinguishes it as secondary reading material, 
although the use of yellow and green are positive colors, which demonstrates an importance to the content.

For most text colour, I used the colour white. 
This is to make it read-able for the users on the dark background colours, and to keep the text consistant with the color of the header and footer logo color's.
The use of 'plain' white is suitable for static content.

In contrast, I used a bright turquoise green colour for the track headings of audio files (on both the home and music pages.). 
This adds importance to the text because it's associated with the interactive parts of the website.

Simularily, I made all the external links bright blue. 
This is because they are separate links to the website and I wanted them to be more distinguished from the page links dark red colouring.

I used the same color for the form submision button's background color (from the hire page) to keep it distinguished.

For all links and the form submission button, I made each turn bright yellow when hovered over. 

The text color of the tour date list and available dates list is also dark red. 
I used a dark red color to make the lists readable over the brighter green and yellow background colors. 
The dark red color keeps the website consistant the other uses of dark red.

I set the copywrite text to a dark grey because it is the least important part of the website for the user.
However it is a bright enough color to keep it readable.

Overall, I used dark version of colors to keep a more relaxed UX experience. 
However the sparse use of brighter versions of colors helped distinguish the interactive parts of the site from the static parts.
For example, the tour dates lists and 'dates available for booking' list, all used shaded versions of colors because it is very static content. 
The links and track headings, on the other hand, both used birght colors to distinguish the content as interactive and/or external to the website.

I used the following link, which helped provide suitable colour schemes:

### Features Left to implement

I will add more pages website with their related page links added to the header.

- Fan Art
- News feed
- Music Videos
- Merchandise
- A forum

I may also add a search bar.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
    -
    - Code for lightbox, from w3schools ( link: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_lightbox.asp ; ).
      Upon utilizing this code, I removed the column class and column css styling, and used bootstrap column grid system instead. 
      This was to keep the website consistant with its use of Bootstrap. I also made several changed to the styling ( see the Existing Features above).
      W3Schools code uses images of the same size and dimensions and because my images were more varied, I had to alter both the HTML and CSS code.

## Testing
Used the following validators to test the code:
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator
https://validator.w3.org/

In testing the UX, I will go over each user story.

##### 1 - listen to the bands music and watch videos (should include atleast one video clip)
I included one promotional video on the home page and multiple music clips on the the home page and music page.
I also provided external links to the bands spotify and itunes accounts for extra music resources for the user to use. These external links can be found on the header and music page.

##### 2 - find links to their social media and other media pages (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, iTunes, Spotify).

The remaining social media links can be found on the footer for the user to access.

##### 3 - look at photos of the band on tour and of each idividual band member.
The photos page shows a photo of each band member. The remaining photos show the rest of the band.

##### - see the bands tour dates, and availability for booking and are able to contact the band to organise gigs.

The tour dates and list of dates for hire can be found on the hire page. The tour dates list is also found on the Home page.
There is contact form on the hire page.



In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing 
to legitimately believe that the site works well. 
Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment


This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).


In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

I developed the project on Cloud9 and ran it through production on GitHub and hosted it on GitHub pages.


I first deployed the home page and CSS file together, after building the Header and Footer while I was developing them at the same time.

Then I copied and pasted the header and footer content on to the remaining three pages and deployed this as my second comit.

Then I built each page and commited the project after each build. 

I ran the project locally through Cloud9.
