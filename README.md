# Band-Website

One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
 
## UX
 
!!!Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This website is for fans and new fans of the band Scorpions, who want to listen to their music, view band photos, check their tour schedule and to able to contact them in order to organise gigs.

As a user, I want to use the webstie to

(a) listen to the bands music and watch their videos (should include atleast one video clip),

(b) find links to their social media and other media pages (i.e. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, iTunes, Spotify).

(c) look at photos of the bands tour, idividual band member profile and other promo photos.

(d) see the bands tour dates, and availability for booking and are able to contact the band to organise gigs.

Wireframes, mockups, diagrams

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The website will have four separate pages, (1) a home page, (2) a music page, (3) a photo page and (4) a gig hire page. Each page will have the same header and footer sections for consitency.

The home page will display a video, one or two examples of their music, a brief description of the band, including a list of band members and a list of tour dates. This will give a solid introduction to the band for new fans and allows them to try their music.

The music page will contain more of the bands music. However it will not be used to display all of their music as external links to Spotify and iTunes will be provided.  

The photos page will contain a vast variety of the band members and pictures of their tours.

The gig hire page will have a contact form and will contain a list of scheduled gigs and dates of availability for fire. This allows user to have a clear understanding of where the band will be playing and where they will be available.


With this in mind, I plan on using external links to Scorpions Spotify and iTunes music playist. This is to provide fans with secondary options of ways to listen to their music. 

The home page will also feature 2 of their new tracks as a preview for their music cataloge. This will be good for attracting new fans. The home page will also include a music video of one their most famous tracks, as another preview of their music cathologe, followed by a link to their YouTube channel. After demonstated
 
### Existing Features

#### Header and Footer

The header will have links to each page to allow for consistant easy access for users and so they dont have to keep navigating around the website to find the correct page. It will also contain the bands logo and a photo of the whole band. This gives new fans an idea to what kind of band the Scorpions are.

As this website will be primarily be used for users to listen to the bands music, I will contain links to the band's Spotify and iTunes accounts on both the header and footer. This is important because it will allow the user to have consistant access to their full music library, from each page. Having consistant links to Spotify and iTunes is also important for the band because the band makes money from these sites.

The footer will include a small logo, copywrite text aswell as a list of all their social media pages. Most of the social media links will be kept on the footer only because they are of secondary importance, however being kept at the footer will allow the user to have consistent access to them. Links to Facebook and Twitter will be included in the list, along with Spotify and iTunes.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
