Header and Footer

I decided to build both the header and footer at te same time because I wanted to use the same colour schemes and because I wanted to compare both while I built them.

I first downloaded logos and images online to see what was available to me already. 
I found three images that suited the header and footer. 

I wanted a small logo for the footer because I want the footer to be shorter in height, atleast in comparison to the header.
Simularly, I wanted to keep the links as small as possible in the footer to make sure the footer wasnt too high.

For the header, I wanted to keep an emphasise on the buttons and links. It was important that I kept enough space around each link for users to click.
At the same time, I also wanted to give importance to the band logo image and profile picture. I didn't want them to too small as this was the first profiling of the band when opening the website.

For the colour sceme I wanted to make sure it blended in with the images. 
I found the black colour code of the footer's image and I used this as the background color of the footer. 
I also used this as the colour background of the header, in order to keep consistancy.

I got the red colour code from the origibal scorpions website which also used red for its links. 
I also added a yellow colouring for the links on hover, in order to add more originality. 
I used the same colour codes for all links to keep it consistant. 

I used links to spotify and itunes on both the header and footer because the main purpose of the website is for fans to find their music.
